### Basic Usage
After downloading template, you can simply edit the HTML and CSS files from the `theme` folder. To preview the changes you make to the code, you can open the index.html file in your web browser.

### Advanced Usage
For advanced usage you have some dependencies to install. Then you can run it on your localhost. You can view the package.json file to see which scripts are included.

#### Install Dependencies
* **Node Installation:** [Install node js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* **Gulp Installation:** Install gulp globally from your terminal 
```
npm install --global gulp-cli
```
Or visit original [docs](https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start)

#### Run Theme
